      <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right:10%;">The goal for this project is to find the best states for post-bachelor degree graduates to live/find work given the conditions that our society is facing due to the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. By focusing on 2020 graduates who are possibly looking for a job and the timeframe of factors needed to improve the economy, we hope to offer some insight for graduates in this troubling time. If one thing is for certain, it is that the job market in the United States will change significantly (compared to pre-COVID-19 times) long after the end of the pandemic. For example, with all of the new methods of virtual communication being perfected right now, can we really assume that all office buildings will continue to be filled to the brim? We might see a decrease in the office buildings needed for companies because people will likely work from home more often. Included, when an employee is sick, they can work from home more efficiently and not lose hours due to a cold. Working from home more often means less commuting and perhaps less polluting of the environment. This could impact the energy sector of the economy in a variety of ways. These are just a few examples of how COVID-19 could have a long-lasting impact on job availability and importance. Furthermore, it reminds us that we are living in unprecedented times and therefore can not exactly predict the future of every job. So, because we do not know the long term impact of the pandemic, we have tried instead to focus on predicting the nature of different industries currently and a few several into the future.
    </p> <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right:10%;"> We compared unemployment rates in context of the pandemic (and what industries the states profit off of), recovery score (considering quality of healthcare system and population density), conditions of the workforce prior to the economic crisis, and salary/cost of living, as most graduates deal with student loans straight out of college. <br><br> This project was designed for the FTL Hackathon, analysed and coded by Jillian V, Madeline E, Katie H, Georgiana.</p>
