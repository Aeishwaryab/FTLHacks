When you click on a intended industry, you will be prompted with a yes or no question, in which youll respond "y" or "n" respectively to the question "Do you want to consider COVID crisis with the data?"

When Technology is chosen, without COVID being a factor, the suggestion will be Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota, Washington.
 
The data backing up our conclusion is under the "Research Tab," where we used Python, Google Sheets and APIs to statistically analyse our data.
